## [intros](/ctpe/Generalization/intros.html)
Typically the first tactic a Coq user ever utilizes.
`intros` looks for assumptions in your goal and moves them to the goal's assumption space.

More specifically, `intros` [specializes](/ctpe/glossary.html#specialize) a goal by looking for [type inhabitation](/ctpe/glossary.html#type_inhabitation) and proposition assumptions and moving them into the assumption space.
For example, if you write `forall (n : nat), n + 0 = n`, the `forall` is acting as an assumption that there is a value of type `nat` that we can call `n`.
Calling `intros` here will provide you an assumption `n` that there is a value of type `nat`.

### Syntax

```coq
(* Simple usage - introduces all named assumptions *)
intros.

(* Give specific names to assumptions as you introduce *)
intros n m x.

(* Split a conjunction or existential assumption upon introducing *)
intros [A B].
```

### Examples

Before
```coq
-------------------------
forall (n : nat), n + 0 = n
```

```coq
intros x.
```

After
```coq
x: nat
-------------------------
1/1
x + 0 = x
```

Before
```coq
-------------------------
forall (A B C : Prop), A /\ B -> C -> A /\ C
```

```coq
intros A B C [ATrue BTrue].
```

After
```coq
A, B, C : Prop
ATrue : A
BTrue : B
-------------------------
1/1
C -> A /\ C
```
