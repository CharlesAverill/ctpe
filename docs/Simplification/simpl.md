## [simpl](/ctpe/Simplification/simpl.html)
`simpl` evaluates terms that are constructed of constant values - not variables.
`simpl` can also partially evaluate partially-constant values.

### Syntax

```coq
(* Simplify the goal as much as possible *)
simpl.

(* Simplify a hypothesis *)
simpl in H.

(* Simplify in the entire proof state *)
simpl in *.

(* Only simplify a specific term in a specific hypothesis *)

```

### Examples
