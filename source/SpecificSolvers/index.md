# Specific Solvers

Each tactic in this group exists to solve a very specific kind of goal.
They're fairly simple to learn about and use, because their goal targets are such small groups that there are hardly any degrees of freedom for automation to be required.
Essentially all Coq proofs include some of these (whether they're written by the programmer or called by more complex tactics).
