# Case Analysis

Case analysis is a core aspect of constructivist logic.
Although for many kinds of problems it is a low-level tool, it is ubiquitous among the foundations of all problems formalized in the Coq system.
The core idea is: "if I want to prove a property P holds for a term t, I can do so by writing multiple sub-proofs that for each form that t can have, P holds."
