# Tacticals

This category refers to tactics that modify the behavior of other tactics.
Important phrasing note for this section: a tactical is only a tactical when it doesn't have all of its arguments. A tactical with all of its arguments is a tactic.
Tacticals are heavily utilized in automation because they broaden the capabilities of the tactic language significantly, making it much more expressive.

For an interesting perspective on automation - and good examples of building "one shot proofs" (proofs that only contain one tactic) - check out [this post by Adam Chlipala](http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/html/Large.html).
