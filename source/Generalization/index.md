# Generalization

This group of tactics is often found at the beginnings of proofs. 
Generalization and its counterpart Specialization (both are included here) are concepts used to fine-tune how strong of a theorem is needed to continue.
Theorems that are too strong (specific) aren't useful for many different kinds of goals.
Theorems that are too weak (general) are frequently unprovable (even if their specified counterparts are!) and those that are provable are frequently harder to prove!
